<h1>Hello World, I Made a Blog</h1>

<div class="article-date">Nov 1, 2020</div>

<p>
    I recently decided to delve into the possibly antiquated world of internet blogging.
    I'm always curious to learn new things and this seemed to be just outside my comfort zone.
    I'm hoping to post regularily, at least once a week. I don't really have any expectations
    for where this blog is going, but I have quite an eclectic list of ideas. More than anything
    I'm hoping that it'll be good motivation to actually explore topics I'm interested in. 
    While ideas and new skills are great, they are best when they are shared. But if my arm was bent, to list a goal I'd 
    say 100 weekly readers and getting featured once on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.
</p>

<h2>Making the blog with Vue.js</h2>
<p>
    Vue.js is a pogressive web framework that has grown rapidly in popularity in the two short years it has existed.
    Some even believe it'll 
    <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/is-vue-js-going-to-take-over-react-in-2020-929c19806ac">overtake React </a>
    which is currently the most popular web framework.  This is the first time I've 
    worked with the Vue and I'd have to say I prefer over any other framework I've used. The templating syntax is very 
    intuitive and powerful. Since I wanted to get this site up  fast I'm only using it very minimally right now but it'll be 
     handy to have when I want to implement some improvements. I really can't overstate how
    I wanted this site to be bare-bones to begin with and I'll improve on it over time as it grows.

<textarea style="height: 40em;">

    <div id="RecentArticles">
        <h1>Recent Articles</h1>
            <div class="article" v-for="article in articles">
                <a class="article-title" v-bind:href="article.link">{{ article.title }}</a>
                <div class="article-summary">{{ article.summary }} ... </div>
                <div class="article-date">{{ article.date }}</div>
            </div>
    </div>
    ...
    var RecentArticles = new Vue({
        el: '#RecentArticles',
        data: {
           articles: [
               { title: "Blog post title", 
                summary: "Lorem ipsum",
                date: "Nov 1, 2020", 
                link: "articles/foo.html", 
            },
           ],
        },
    
    })
</textarea>

<p>
    The template is linked by its DOM id to the corresponding Vue instance and the mustache sytax is used to bind the data to the template. 
    The 'v-for' directive is used to loop through the articles. It isn't illustrated in this example but the framework is also reactive.
    Which means if the data the view will also change. 
</p>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<p>
    Right now adding to the blog means writing the HTML then adding the JSON to the data object in the Vue instance.
    This is fine, but it'd be better to make a tool that automatically gets that information from the articles folder just by 
    scraping the HTML. So in the future all I have to do is write the html of the article. Here are some other improvements
</p>

<ol>
    <li>A header and footer template</li>
    <li>Automatic reading time estimates for articles aka a word counter</li>
    <li>Sorting of the articles list by date</li>
    <li>A title for the blog, right now it is just "Blog Title"</li>
    <li>A code block component with syntax highlighting</li>
    <li>Dark mode (a must)</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Other then those I'm also gonna be doing some research on how to market
    blog sites, so you can probably expect a short article on what I find out from that. 
    If you have any suggestions on how you I'd love to hear from you. Email me directly 
    at elijah.tesch@gmail.com.
