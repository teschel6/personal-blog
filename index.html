<h1>Blog Title</h1>

<p>Hello Internet! I'm Eli and welcome to my blog. 
During the day I work as a software developer for a mid-sized insurance company. I recently graduated college (yes, during the pandemic) 
with a degree in computer science and math. I'm gonna be using this site to post things I find
interesting. It might be math, coding, a new hobby,
or internet challenge I'm trying. I have a wide range of interests so
I'll be discussing many different things here, but above all I
just like to learn new things and I want to share that
process of learning and discovery with others.</p>

<p> If you have any suggestions or topics you would like to see me discuss
    <a href="mailto:elijah.tesch@gmail.com?subject=feedback">email me.</a>
